#This project creates an animated heart effect on an HTML canvas. 
#The hearts appear on the canvas when the user clicks or moves the mouse over it, and they are drawn as animated shapes that change over time. 
#The hearts can have different sizes, colors, and behaviors, and they gradually fade away as they move.
